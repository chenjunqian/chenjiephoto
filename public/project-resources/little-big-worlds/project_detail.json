    "description": "I also have interest in lofty things, those impressive natural or artificial views.<br/>The Locana Buddha, for example, was created by people in homage to their belief. It is a mighty figure crafted by ancient artisans with their flesh and blood and superb skills.<br/> While, in the vast natural world, things created by nature are infinite, which is the cornerstone of progress in human intelligence. <br/>In these photos, every tree, river or image is the focus, framed in scale to create a sense of awe. <br/>My photos focus on both human progress and the tranquility of nature. As a quote by Robert Adams says, “The job of the photographer, in my view, is not to catalogue indisputable fact but to try to be coherent about intuition and hope.”",
